Description: This package will run object detection models on camera trap images. There is a general model that detects, counts, and classifies objects as birds, humans, (non-human) mammals, and vehicles, while also IDing empty images. There is another model that goes to the species level, and a third model that classifies to the family level. The `deploy_model` function is most relevent and will run each type of model on your images. The `runShiny` function will launch a Shiny Application to run the `deploy_model` function.
